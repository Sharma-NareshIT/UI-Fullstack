- HTML is a collection of Elements arranged in a hierarchy called DOM.
  [Document Object Model]

- HTML presents static DOM.
- JavaScript, jQuery, React, Angular, Vue etc. convert the static DOM into dynamic DOM.
- Tags are used to build element.
- Tags are Tokens
- Tag => Element     [Tokenization]

		    Types of Elements in HTML
		    =====================
1. Normal Elements
2. Void Elements
3. RC Data Elements
4. Raw Text Elements
5. Foreign Elements

Normal Elements:

Void Elements:
=========== 
- Void means no-return type.
- These elements will not return any presentation directly on callback.
- They require additional attributes.
- They can return specified content and end implicitly.
- They dosen't require end tag.

RC Data Elements:
===============
- These are the container elements used to present plain text content.
- Rich Content is not allowed.

	<textarea> </textarea>
